# LAS Project
LAS is a Python application for a place administration staff to track client, user number based on hours, months and days. It provides a beneficial information for staff to manage timetable for place.

Firstly we have a page that staff can register a new user. When user is registered, an email that includes QR code sents to user's mail and with the button in right-hand side, user can scan QR code and enters to place.
