# LAS Project
LAS is a Python application for a place administration staff to track client, user number based on hours, months and days. It provides a beneficial information for staff to manage timetable for place.

Firstly we have a page that staff can register a new user. When user is registered, an email that includes QR code sents to user's mail and with the button in right-hand side, user can scan QR code and enters to place.

Then, when user inside the place, staff can see the current users that in place currently with occupuncy rate with "live" page on dashboard. When user leaves from place. User scan the QR code again and dashboard get updates.

Additionaly, on "General" page dashboard provides all users registered, users by month, users by days and hours. We use scrollbar to see different graphs. This comprehensive data allows staff to analyze trends and plan accordingly.
